Overview
Background
Power utilities perform routine thermal inspections of distribution transformers to detect anomalies like overheating, insulation degradation, and load imbalances. Currently, these inspections rely on manual comparison of thermal images, making them time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. There is a strong need to automate and digitize this workflow while ensuring traceability, efficiency, and adaptability.
Your Challenge
Design and develop a complete software solution that allows users to:
Record and manage transformers and their associated image data
Automatically detect temperature anomalies in new images using computer vision
Allow users to manually validate or correct detected anomalies
Generate a maintenance record sheet with marked anomalies and editable fields
This project will be executed in four phases, and your solution must support the flow of data and insights across all of them.

Phase 1 – Transformer and Baseline Image Management
FR1.1: Build an admin interface to add transformer records (ID, location, capacity).
FR1.2: Enable uploading of thermal images (baseline and maintenance) tagged to transformers.
FR1.3: Categorize baseline images by environmental conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Phase 2 – Automated Anomaly Detection
FR2.1: Implement an AI-based comparison engine to detect anomalies in new images.
FR2.2: Display side-by-side comparison of new and baseline images.
FR2.3: Automatically highlight potential hotspots and deviations based on thresholds.
Phase 3 – Interactive Annotation & Feedback
FR3.1: Allow engineers to manually adjust detected anomalies or annotate new ones.
FR3.2: Save annotated images with metadata (user, timestamp).
FR3.3: Feed annotations back into the model pipeline for improved accuracy (retraining or correction tagging).
Phase 4 – Maintenance Record Sheet Generation
FR4.1: Generate a transformer-specific digital maintenance form with the thermal diagram pre-marked.
FR4.2: Allow manual input of other required fields.
FR4.3: Save completed records in the system under the relevant transformer.

Phase 1 – Transformer and Baseline Image Management
Overview
In this phase, your team will lay the foundation of the system by implementing essential functionalities to manage transformer records and their associated baseline thermal images. This includes setting up the core data models, admin interfaces for data entry, and image uploading mechanisms. The primary goal is to create a structured and searchable repository of transformers and their thermal imaging data under various environmental conditions.
Scope
You are required to implement the following functional requirements for Phase 1:
FR1.1: Admin Interface for Transformer Management
Add new transformer records
View and edit existing transformer records
Delete transformer entries if necessary
FR1.2: Thermal Image Upload and Tagging
Allow uploading of thermal images to specific transformer entries
Images must be tagged as either:
Baseline: Used as the reference image for future comparisons
Maintenance: New images used for periodic inspections
Each image must be associated with metadata such as:
Upload date/time
Image type (Baseline / Maintenance)
Uploader (admin user ID or name)
FR1.3: Categorization by Environmental Conditions
While uploading a baseline image, the user must tag it with the observed environmental condition:
Sunny
Cloudy
Rainy
Environmental conditions should be selectable via a dropdown during image upload.
Additional Technical Requirements:
Image storage should support efficient retrieval and viewing
Transformer and image metadata should be stored in a relational database
Admin interface should be accessible via a web browser
Follow a modular architecture that supports easy extension in future phases

Phase 2 – Automated Anomaly Detection
Overview
In Phase 2, you will build and integrate an AI-based engine to automatically detect thermal anomalies in transformer images. This is a critical capability in digitizing and scaling thermal inspection workflows. Your task is to compare new (maintenance) thermal images with previously stored baseline images, identify deviations such as hotspots, and present them to the user in a clear and intuitive interface. The system must support comparison logic, anomaly detection based on pre-defined thresholds, and a visual display that helps users understand the insights derived by the AI model.
Scope
You are required to implement the following functional requirements for Phase 2:
FR2.1: AI-Based Anomaly Detection Engine
Design or integrate a computer vision model (classical or DL-based) to:
Compare new maintenance images with baseline images of the same transformer
Detect thermal anomalies such as temperature spikes, asymmetries, or changes in hotspot locations.
Define a thresholding mechanism (fixed or adaptive) to flag anomalies
FR2.2: Side-by-Side Image Comparison View
Display new (maintenance) and baseline images side by side
Include basic controls such as zoom, move (click and drag), and reset
Highlight anomaly regions visually (e.g., bounding boxes, overlays, heatmaps)
FR2.3: Automatic Anomaly Marking
When anomalies are detected:
Automatically annotate the image with color-coded overlays or markers
Display metadata such as pixel coordinates, anomaly size, and severity score
Include a confidence score or flag where the model is unsure
Additional Technical Requirements:
Ensure model inference time is optimized for responsive performance
Support modular integration so that the anomaly detection engine can evolve over time
Record all detection outputs and metadata for later retrieval or feedback (for Phase 3)

Phase 3 – Interactive Annotation & Feedback
Overview
In Phase 2, you developed a system that automatically detects anomalies in transformer thermal images. In Phase 3, you will extend this functionality by enabling human-in-the-loop feedback through interactive annotation tools. This allows engineers or admin users to validate, correct, or reject detected anomalies and add their own annotations where necessary. This phase is essential to enhance the system’s accuracy and usability in real-world operations, as manual oversight plays a key role in critical maintenance workflows. Additionally, user corrections and annotations must be stored for potential model retraining or analysis in later phases.
Scope
You are required to implement the following functional requirements:
FR3.1: Interactive Annotation Tools
On the anomaly detection view (from Phase 2), enable users to:
Adjust existing anomaly markers (resize, reposition)
Delete incorrectly detected anomalies
Add new anomaly markers by drawing bounding boxes or polygonal regions
All annotations should include:
Annotation type (e.g., added / edited / deleted)
Optional comments or notes
Timestamp and user ID
FR3.2: Metadata and Annotation Persistence
When a user interacts with the anomaly detection view, all changes must be:
Captured and saved in the backend
Stored along with metadata (user ID, timestamp, image ID, transformer ID, action taken)
Shown in the UI
Existing annotations should be automatically reloaded when the same image is revisited.
FR3.3: Feedback Integration for Model Improvement
Maintain a feedback log that includes:
Original AI-generated detections
Final user-modified annotations
This log will serve as training or validation data for improving the detection model
Use the user-modified annotations to improve the accuracy of the AI model
The feedback log must be exportable in JSON or CSV format with:
Image ID
Model-predicted anomalies
Final accepted annotations
Annotator metadata
Saving previous versions of the annotated image in the user interface and switching between them is not within the scope of this project.
Additional Technical Requirements:
Annotation tools must be intuitive and user-friendly (use standard UI components where possible)
All annotation actions must be logged without requiring the user to manually "save"
Store image-to-annotation relationships in a structured and queryable format (relational DB or NoSQL)
Resources Provided
The following will be provided to assist in Phase 3 implementation:
Extended UI Designs: Annotated mockups showing the expected interaction flow (edit/delete/add annotations) Link
Sample Annotation Format: JSON schema to store annotations and metadata. Link
Guidelines: Examples of what constitutes a good vs. poor annotation. Link
Demo Data: Sample image sets with expected ground-truth annotations for validation. Link
Deliverables
Your Phase 3 submission must include:
A fully working interface to interact with anomalies detected in Phase 2
Users should be able to view, modify, delete, and add annotations
Backend support for:
Annotation storage and retrieval
User metadata logging
Export of annotation logs

Description of the annotation system

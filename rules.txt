Anomaly Detection in Transformers and Associated Equipment Using Thermal Images
Objective
The goal of this project is to detect abnormal conditions (faults) in transformers and associated equipment using thermal images. You will be provided with a dataset of thermal images in JPEG or PNG format. The task is to classify whether a thermal image shows a normal condition or a faulty condition.
Dataset Structure
The dataset contains images from 13 transformers. For each transformer, the data is organized as follows:
TX/
    ├── normal/
    │     ├── TX_normal_001.jpg
    │     ├── TX_normal_002.jpg
    │     └── ...
    └── faulty/
          ├── TX_faulty_001.jpg
          ├── TX_faulty_002.jpg
          └── ...
Normal folder → Images of the transformer in good condition.


Faulty folder → Images showing abnormal operating conditions (faulty or potentially faulty).
Thermal Image Color Scale
The thermal images use a continuous color scale, moving smoothly from dark blue to dark red through intermediate colors.
Cool areas → appear in black or bluish shades.


Moderate areas → appear in yellowish or orange shades.


Hot areas → appear in reddish shades.


The interpretation of these colors, relative to their background, helps in identifying whether a transformer is in normal or faulty condition.
Normal Images
Mostly black or bluish areas.


No reddish or orange spots that stand out.


Indicates the transformer is operating in good condition.



Faulty and Potentially Faulty Images
There are two types of abnormal situations observed in the dataset: loose joints and overloads.
1. Loose Joint Condition
A loose joint creates a hotspot at the connection point.
Faulty: If the middle of the joint appears reddish or orange-yellowish, compared to a blue/black background, it is a clear fault.


Potentially Faulty: If the middle of the joint is yellowish (not reddish or orange) compared to the blue/black background, it is potentially faulty.













2. Overloaded Condition
Overloading causes heating along a wire.
Point Overload (Faulty): If a small point or small area on the wire appears reddish or orange-yellowish, while the rest of the wire is in black/blue or yellowish, it is a faulty case.


Point Overload (Potentially Faulty): If a small point or small area on the wire appears yellowish, while the rest of the wire is in black/blue, it is a potentially faulty case.


Full Wire Overload (Potentially Faulty): If the entire wire appears in reddish or yellowish colors, it is considered potentially faulty. This could be due to operational load rather than a permanent fault.

Guidelines
Always compare the hotspot area with its background. A valid anomaly appears when a reddish or yellowish spot contrasts with a mostly blue/black background. When we say “background”, we don’t mean the background of the transformer (e.g., sky, building, or trees). This is the background of the relevant component in the thermal image (parts of the transformer).


Use the color intensity and distribution to classify the image into one of the categories:
Normal
Faulty (loose joint/point overload)
Potentially Faulty (yellowish loose joint or full wire overload)


If uncertain, focus on whether the contrast with the background clearly indicates abnormal heating.


Objective is to minimize fault negatives because false positives go through a human verification step, but false negatives do not!
